# Git gut at jQuery MA1
 A jQuery carousel


## Getting started

For this plugin you will need to link your page to jQuery for it to work. [link for script tag](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.1/jquery.min.js)


## Adding the HTML components

The first thing you need to add to your HTML page is the components needed for the carousel. You can copy everything inside and including the **carousel-container** div. All images used will be included in the download (inside assets/images).

If you want to display more than 3 images, you simply duplicate everything inside the **slide** div. The image amounts and the links for the images must be changed. 


## Styling

The provided styling includes both a .css and a .styl file for easy use. Remember to link to the CSS file. No aditional stylesheets, like bootstrap, are used.


## Scripts 

For the carousel to work properly after adding the HTML components, you must remember to link the jQuery script at the end of the document followed by the carousel script as done in the provided files. If the jQuery script does not come first, it will not work.
